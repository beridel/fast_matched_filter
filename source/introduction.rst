Introduction

Description
-----------
An efficient seismic matched-filter search for both CPU and GPU architectures.

| If you use FMF in research to be published, please reference the following article:
| Beauc√©, Eric, W. B. Frank, and Alexey Romanenko (2017). Fast matched-filter (FMF): an efficient seismic matched-filter search for both CPU and GPU architectures.
| *Seismological Research Letters*, doi: `10.1785/0220170181 <https://doi.org/10.1785/0220170181>`_

FMF is available at `https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter <https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter>`_ and can be downloaded with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter.git

Installation
-------------

From source
^^^^^^^^^^^
A simple make + whichever implementation does the trick. Possible make commands are:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make python_cpu
    $ make python_gpu
    $ make matlab

NB: Matlab compiles via mex, which needs to be setup before running. Any compiler can be chosen during the setup of mex, because it will be bypassed by the CC environment variable in the Makefile. Therefore CC must be set to an OpenMP-compatible compiler.


Using pip
^^^^^^^^^

Installation as a Python module is possible via pip (which supports clean uninstalling):

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py build_ext
    $ pip install .

or simply:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter


Required software/hardware:
---------------------------
* A C compiler that supports OpenMP (default Mac OS compiler clang does not support OpenMP; gcc can be easily downloaded via homebrew), 
* CPU version: either Python (v2.7 or 3.x) or Matlab, 
* GPU version: Python (v2.7 or 3.x) and a discrete Nvidia graphics card that supports CUDA C with CUDA toolkit installed. 

FMF is known to run well with gcc 6.8.X, and cuda 10.0.
